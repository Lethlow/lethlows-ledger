> My ADHD brain needs progress to stay motivated, so I built Lethlow's Ledger. This simple Alt1 app turns your RS3 moneymaking into a game. Earn "Moneymaking XP" from flips and drops to level up and track your total profit. Includes a 'Bored?' page for ideas. All your data is stored locally.

Lethlow's Ledger is a lightweight, all-in-one Alt1 application designed to help you track your moneymaking activities in RuneScape 3, turning profit tracking into a rewarding, gamified experience.

**All your data is stored locally and privately on your computer; nothing is ever uploaded or shared.**

## Core Features

* **Universal Dashboard:** At a glance, see your total profit, current Moneymaking Level, XP progress, and all unlocked achievements.

* **Flipping Tracker:** Add your active Grand Exchange flips. When you sell them, the app automatically calculates your profit and moves the transaction to a permanent Trade Log.

* **PvM Drop Log:** Easily log valuable drops from bossing and slayer. The value of these drops contributes directly to your total profit and XP.

* **Gamified Progression:** Earn "Moneymaking XP" for every gp you make. Level up and unlock achievements to mark your progress from a fledgling merchant to a Gielinorian tycoon.

* **"Bored?" Sheet:** A simple page with quick links to helpful RuneScape Wiki guides and popular content creators for when you're not sure what to do next.

* **Custom Theme:** A modern, necrotic green and pink theme inspired by RuneScape 3's newer content.
